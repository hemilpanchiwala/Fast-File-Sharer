Fast-File-Sharer is a simple ReactJS based web application that allows users to share files quickly. It provides a simple interface to send the files to the another user by simply providing his/her registered email-id. It is currently hosted on Heroku with the link provided in the repository description. Its backend is built upon a NodeJS server with PostgreSQL as a database for storing files. Yet many of the more features can be implemented in this which can make it a far more better product than what it is currently.
